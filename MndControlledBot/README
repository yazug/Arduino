Think about it - and it moves. Think harder, the robot moves faster. 
But don't worry; as a robot it knows to avoid the black border so it 
doesn't fall off the table.

"Make a Mind Controlled Arduino Robot" shows you how to build your 
own. You learn to measure attention level with a NeuroSky headband and
send this information into Arduino. You will also build a 
line-avoiding system into the bot. And, of course, you will build the 
chassis of your robot from scratch.
